# Glitchout
### Is an update project of moving to Unity [my previous beta game GlitchedOut from GMS I made in 2018](https://github.com/HyperGamesDev/GlitchedOut-GMS-0.1-).
## A bizzare quick and fun PvP arena game!

I initially worked on this for like 2 weeks to get a break from [my first Unity project SSS222](https://github.com/HyperGamesDev/sss222)
And when I tried adding in multiplayer I added the basics like the connection with Photon but "turned out" (lmao) I had to rewrite the whole code,
I never tried working with networking so I quickly gave up.
At some point Ill get back to this project..

Roadmap:
- [] 0.2 - Basic Remake in Unity {+Multiplayer} + More features

(Potential updates)
- [ ] 0.3 - Leveling, Daily Quests
