# Glitchout
### Is an update project of moving to Unity [my previous beta game GlitchedOut from GMS I made in 2018](https://github.com/HyperGamesDev/GlitchedOut-GMS-0.1-).
## A bizzare quick and fun PvP arena game!

I initially worked on this for like 2 weeks to get a break from [my first Unity project SSS222](https://github.com/HyperGamesDev/sss222) in July 2020, and got back to the project a year later and actually finished the networking
